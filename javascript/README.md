When the new particles coming into system's injection angle is set to the normal vector of injecting surface, the density is conserved with around 10% error.
When the injection angle is set as +45 degree or -45 degree with the normal vector of the surface, the density is conserved with around 30% error.
When the injection angle is set as +90 degree or -90 degree with the normal vector of the surface, the density is conserved with around 50% error, rarely conserved.
